\begin{itemize}
	\item In OJ's most of the problems concerning MST's can be solved with Kruskal's algorithm.(others are Prim's and Boruvka's)

\section{Trees}

While performing tree dp we can keep a map (of values in the subtree) at each node. This is a very generic trick and seems to have high potential.

we will traverse the tree from the down most level (level wise).

\begin{itemize}
	\item Have maps at each of the lowest level nodes.(each map has only one entry)
	\item Now when we go up to produce map of node 'u' in this level.\\
	Take the largest map among children of u and add remaining children maps in to this big map. Now add the value corresponding to 'u' to the map. Now this map is the final map for 'u'.
	\item Since when each node moves from one map m1 to other m2, $sizeof(m2) \geq sizeof(m1)$. Final size of m2 after addition will be $\geq 2*sizeof(m1)$. So any node will change maps only $lg(n)$ times. So the time complexity is $O(nlg(n))$.
	\item The memory is $O(n)$ throught out the procedure. Since we are inserting smaller maps in to the big map(which is already present).
	\item This can be implemented using dfs.
\end{itemize}
